While I was an undergraduate student, I helped preparing
materials for the graduate class about operating systems architecture.
We based our work on the
[xv6 booklet from MIT](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2023/xv6/book-riscv-rev3.pdf)
that I translated to French, and sent back some improvements to MIT.
