I am currently a Visiting student researcher at UC Berkeley in the Department
of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) and I am looking for
a PhD position starting in Fall 2024.
My main interests in research are for operating system architecture,
scheduling and distributed systems.

Research experience
===

My work at UC Berkeley consist in designing a fair leaderless ordering service.
This work is done under the supervision
of [Pr. Natacha Crooks](https://nacrooks.github.io/).
Before that, I was transforming xv6 into a multikernel
at Telecom SudParis/IP Paris in France with
[Pr. GaÃ«l Thomas](https://www-public.imtbs-tsp.eu/~thomas_g/)
and [Pr. Mathieu Bacou](https://bacou.wp.imtbs-tsp.eu/).
I also had a previous research experience at Univeristy of Neuchatel,
Switzerland about making asynchronous cross-enclave calls for SGX efficient,
which leads to the publication of our paper in DSN 2023.

Teaching Experience
===

While I was an undergraduate student, I helped my teacher preparing
materials for the graduate class about operating systems architecture.
We based our work on the
[xv6 booklet from MIT](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2023/xv6/book-riscv-rev3.pdf)
that I translated to French, and sent back some improvements to MIT
that leads my name to be added in the *acknowledgments* section
of the original booklet.


Activities and Interests
===

I love music in general. I have taken piano lessons for about 15 years and
am currently playing in a jazz band named Groovie Boulga.
I have also completed a 4 years junior firefighter training program
that I stopped once I entered college.


Feel free to contact me if you want to talk about my research interests,
or music, or even about what makes you happy in life; I always enjoy
to exchange cool tips!
