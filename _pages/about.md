I am currently a Visiting Student Researcher at UC Berkeley in the Department
of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), and I am looking for
a PhD position starting in Fall 2024.
My main interests in research are operating systems architecture,
scheduling, and distributed systems.


Research Experience
===

My work at UC Berkeley consists of designing a fair,
leaderless ordering service, which I have done under the supervision
of [Prof. Natacha Crooks](https://nacrooks.github.io/).
Before that, I transformed xv6 into a multikernel
at Telecom SudParis/IP Paris in France with
[Prof. Gaël Thomas](https://www-public.imtbs-tsp.eu/~thomas_g/)
and [Prof. Mathieu Bacou](https://bacou.wp.imtbs-tsp.eu/).
I have also had a previous research experience at the University of Neuchâtel,
Switzerland, making SGX switchless calls efficient and configless,
which led to the publication of
[a paper in DSN 2023](https://tzerbib.github.io/publication/2023-06_SGX_Switchless_Calls_Made_Configless).


Teaching Experience
===

While I was an undergraduate student, I helped prepare materials
for a graduate class on operating systems architecture.
We based our work on the
[xv6 booklet from MIT](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2023/xv6/book-riscv-rev3.pdf).
After I translated it into French, I sent back improvements,
which were acknowledged in the updated booklet.


Activities and Interests
===

Aside from trying to figure out the best soluion to a problem, I do music, and I love that!
I have taken piano lessons for about 15 years and
am currently playing in a jazz band named Groovie Boulga.
I also completed four years of a firefighter training program
that I stopped once I entered college.


Feel free to contact me if you want to talk about my research interests,
music, or even about what makes you happy in life; I always enjoy
exchanging cool tips!
